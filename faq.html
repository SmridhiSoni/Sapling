            <li>How will my plants arrive?</li>
            <p>When your plants arrive if they do not resemble the picture on the website and seem dry, please don't
                worry we anticipate this. We have years of experience so let us explain. Our photos are for illustrative
                purposes only, the pictures on the website are of mature plants in their flowering season. As we deal in
                live products the season and weather dictates the condition. Sizes and measurements of plants on our
                website are approximate, they can vary significantly in size between seasons. </p>
            <p>With mail order plants, the power of the plant is stored in its root system. We understand they may not
                initially look as attractive as plants in a garden centre, but they are just as strong or even stronger.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because people usually buy plants by their appearance, plants are forced into flower to look attractive
                in a garden centre, but will get quite a shock once brought home and planted in your garden. They can
                take some time to fully recover if ever. Our plants do not waste any energy, they are hardened off and
                just waiting to boost into life in your garden.
            </p>
            <p>If you follow our guidelines enclosed, you will be rewarded in the growing season by watching your plants
                grow into mature and very strong plants.</p>
            <p>Rest assured your order is guaranteed so if you are still unhappy please contact our customer service.
                Saplings wishes you lots of success with your garden.</p>
            <li>Do I get a replacement if my items are damaged?</li>
            <p>If there is something wrong with your item(s) such as it has been damaged in transit or hasn't survived
                the journey, just contact us as soon as possible describing the problem and we will happily replace the
                item for you free of charge under your guarantee. Some items are perishable and there will be no need to
                return dead or damaged plants; however we may ask for photos for quality control purposes.</p>
            <p>Please see in our Terms and Conditions for our Return Policy, any questions please contact customer
                service.</p>
            <li>What if I want to return the product which I have received?</li>
            <p>If the product received by you as same as shown on the website and matching the size and color shown, you
                will need to ship the product back to us bearing the shipping cost. However if the item is different,
                damaged or not as described on the website, we will arrange for a pickup from your address free of cost.
            </p>
            <li>Will I get all items I ordered at once?</li>
            <p>GoGreen.com is a marketplace, we have our vendors spread across India. If you have ordered multiple
                items in the same order, there are chances those items are from different vendors, and so you might be
                receiving the order in separate parcels. If the vendor for all your products is the same, then you will
                surely receive all the items at once. Tracking id of orders shipped from each vendor are updated and
                sent on your registered email id and phone number.</p>
            <li>Do your plants come with pots?</li>
            <p>All our plants except the orchids will come with a plastic pot. The soil used in potting is a mixture of
                coco peat, perlite and vermiculite.</p>
